# About Us
Concordia Evangelical Lutheran Church in Watertown New York wants you to See, Grow, and Serve in the Ways of the Christian Faith.

As a member of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, our faith is built around a strong belief in God as made known to us in Jesus Christ. Through worship, service and education, we practice our faith, grow our relationship with God and experience God's grace in our lives.

## New Here?
We love new comers and all are welcome! Here are some common questions we get:

*Is there any childcare during the church service?*

Childcare for infants and toddlers is not provided during the service, but we do have a nursery for your convenience. A speaker is present in the nursery so you can listen to the service.

*Is there any Sunday school for my children?*

Children in preschool through sixth grade attend church school following the service. Grades seven through twelve attend a youth group gathering following the service.

*Is there any time for fellowship?*

Following our service, we have a fellowship to meet and mingle serving coffee and snacks.
